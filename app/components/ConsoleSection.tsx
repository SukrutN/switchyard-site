 * The site mirrors the yardmaster console — the read-only companion
 * binary the broker repo ships (switchyard PR #10) — and lets the page
 * drive it: a replay seeded from the REAL snapshot the console served
 * (2026-10-22T17:28:00Z), with buttons for the recorded bring-up. Wire
 * receipts print spur's own words; every replayed op costs the journal
 * delta the yard actually charged, measured live during the bring-up.
 * The section's copy keeps the honesty law: this is a replay, the live
 * console runs where the binary runs.

          <span className="mono">yardmaster</span> is the yard&apos;s
          console. It&apos;s a companion binary that runs beside a live
          yard, connects as an ordinary client through the same gate and
          framing <span className="mono">spur</span> uses, and shows what
          the console family (§2.24–§2.27) and the KV reads (§2.19–§2.21)
          answer. The pages it serves are part of the binary.

          It owns no levers: every panel is a read, quarantine is
          reported, not cleared, and the console cannot write a single
          byte to the yard. The panel below is a replay of the recorded
          bring-up, so you can publish, attach, ack, and cut the wire
          without a real yard. When you want the real one, run the
          binary.
